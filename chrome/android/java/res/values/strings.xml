    Every time a new user follows a link sent by you and installs Mass Browser you get an equivalent of $1 in Mass Coins.\n\n

    To prove the installation is not made by robots/fraudulent software we need some time (usually couple of weeks) to make sure that your friend is a real human who uses Mass.\n\n

    You can either withdraw Mass Coins in available currencies or pay with it at our partners\' locations/websites.
